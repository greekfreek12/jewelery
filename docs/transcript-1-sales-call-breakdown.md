# Sales Call Breakdown - How I Close Clients for $246K/Month Agency

This is exactly how I close clients for our $246,000 a month agency. Basically, what we do is we sell contractors and home service businesses on a $297 plan offering a website and then we'll try to upsell them other services later on. This was back when I was still taking sales calls.

## The Numbers

- Currently at 246K MRR
- Did about 284K last month
- Affiliate income: about 11K/month (14K in December, 11K in January)

## The Opening

I basically just said, "Hey, what's up, man? Did you get a chance to watch the short video we sent over to you?"

People keep asking me what that video is. It's literally just a basic video of me covering what we do, like a website, and then saying, "Hey, here's how it works." It's just me showing the value of our offer.

**The framework for every call:**
1. "Cool. Did you get a chance to watch the video?"
2. "Cool. What questions do you have?"

## Handling "No Questions"

When somebody says they don't actually have any questions, then why don't they just pay you, right? They obviously have questions. Otherwise, they would just say, "Cool, I'm ready to go. Here's my credit card."

**Key insight:** A less experienced sales guy might have just gone in straight and started pitching. That would be the worst possible thing you could do. People will try to bait you into pitching them. Home service businesses, small businesses in general are very good at knowing when they're being pitched.

## Identifying Pain Points

The prospect asked: "So how does the website thing work? Because I have a website but we looked at it. It's not great."

**Bullseye.** Now I know his website's the problem.

## Assuming the Close

I said: "Can you send us pictures and all that?"

This gives them a vision of what their new website could look like. We're getting them emotionally bought into our process.

## The Process Breakdown

"Basically just have you fill out a form - what services do you provide? What service areas do you service? Tell me why you're special? How long have you been in business? We use that form to create a new website and then we ask you for photos. All the AI and systems we just implement into the new website."

## Building Authority

I explained what a website is for: "It's really just like an online business card - making you look professional and making sure when somebody reaches out you reach back to them as fast as possible."

He's like, "Yep, yep, that makes sense." Now he's slowly seeing me as an expert. **People buy from people they trust and see as an authority figure.**

## Mentioning Upsells Casually

"The Google page is way more important. Get the Google page set up. Optimize it correctly. You can do that or we can do it for you."

**Key tactic:** If you're going to do an upsell, casually mention it at the beginning of the call and then hook it back in at the end of the call.

## Handling "When Will I Get Leads?"

This is one of the hardest questions to answer. Here's how:

"Dude, I can't prove to you that in six months when you have 100 Google reviews and a beautiful website, how many more people are going to work with you. I just know for sure that when somebody sees one of our websites versus your current website, they're going to choose our website because we look more professional."

## Handling "Too Good to Be True"

When he said it seemed too good to be true, I explained:

"When you have what we have - like 320 clients paying you 300 bucks a month, it's pretty chill. We can onboard like 80 to 100 guys a month and then half of them take the upsell with Google ads."

**Be transparent:** "When you give someone a low ticket product like a $297, it's very easy to get them to say yes. And then when you give them some good stuff, the next person they come to buy more from is you."

## Permission to Close

I asked: "Cool, dude. What other questions you have, man?"

He said: "Nothing really."

Then: "Do you have any other questions before we get you going?"

**Super important.** Really easy way to transition to the close.

## The Upsell Attempt

"When that Google page is created, if you want us to go through and optimize it for you, either we charge 300 bucks for it. Or if you pay for three months up front, we go and do it for free. Or third option is you can do it yourself. I can send you a video."

He chose month-to-month at $297.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Don't pitch** - Let them ask questions
2. **Assume the close** - Talk as if they're already a customer
3. **Show expertise casually** - Don't be salesy
4. **Be transparent** - About your business model, pricing, everything
5. **Mention upsells early** - Then bring them back at the end
6. **Sales calls are like dates** - Just be honest and authentic

The call closed at **12 minutes and 47 seconds**.
