## How It Started

I had a friend from college. I was broke after college, no idea what was going on. Called my buddy and asked what he was into. He said, "Dude, I just learned about this new thing called Go High Level."

Instantly, I saw it and was like, "I have no idea how I'm going to make money with this thing, but this is an amazing tool."

The only reason I chose websites is I didn't know how to do anything else. I knew what a website was and I knew that business owners knew what websites were.

## Getting First Clients

My original business partner Ian flew out here to Hawaii. We boot camped for like 10 days - just spammed Go High Level, messed with buttons, the website builder, messed everything up 100 times.

Then we just started cold calling. Day three, we just spam cold calls. Tried to sell reviews, tried to sell websites. Neither of us had any idea how to build any of the stuff.

**Got our first client after 5-6 days of cold calling.** Got him on a two-week free trial and then $97/month after that. David, a dog groomer - literally first client's still with us.

## The Truth About Taking Action

The issue is people just don't take action. They sit on their ass all day asking "What if this goes wrong?"

**Bro, shit's going wrong no matter what you do.**

You can sit there and watch YouTube videos for four hours or you can make four hours worth of cold calls. You will make more money from the cold calls every single time.

## On Business Partnerships

99.9% of the time, don't get a partner. If it wasn't for Mike (my current partner who's like a little mini Elon Musk), I'd say do it yourself.

**Never partner with someone who has the exact same skill set as you. It just doesn't work out.**

Find an accountability partner instead - someone that can work with you and share ideas.

## First Delivery vs Now

**First website:**
- Took us 20 hours
- Looked like shit
- Images all over the place
- Buttons didn't work
- But we gave top tier support - on calls with him all day

**Now:**
- VA handles it
- Whole thing's basically built with AI
- Send onboarding form to client
- Form goes into ChatGPT, goes into Go High Level
- 25-page website pops out for about $50 (paying a VA)

## The Mindset Beginners Need

Beginners think it has to be perfect and optimized on day one.

**We were at 30K a month and our websites were still a shit show.** Websites worked, but optimization wasn't there. Process took forever. Buttons broken.

At $34K/month, our email sending domains still didn't work. We literally could not send emails to clients.

At $180K/month now, our text messages just got shut down yesterday for 24 hours.

**Shit just breaks. Get used to it.**

## The Sales Pitch

$297/month. We just say, "Hey, this is exactly what we do. Take it or leave it."

**You're selling a system, not a lead generation service.** Leads come as a byproduct of the system you set up.

I can't say "You're going to get this much more business." I can only tell you that more Google reviews and a better website equals more business.

## The Only Advantage I've Ever Had

The only thing I think I'm actually good at is just blindly doing stuff. I'm not tech-savvy. Average intelligence.

But I don't give a shit if I'm embarrassed, if I look dumb. I will just continue to do stuff.

**That's the biggest advantage you can have as a beginner by far.**

## Cold Calling to Ads Timeline

- Cold called to 16-17 clients
- Started ads around 3-4K/month
- Wasted like $5,000, got scammed out of $5,000 from some course

**Ads are definitely the fastest way to scale. But there's zero reason to spend money on ads if you haven't done a thousand cold calls and figured out your messaging.**

Otherwise, you're just going to waste money.

## The Cold Calling Process

I would literally take my iPhone, go on Google Maps and type in "roofer in Las Vegas." Next day "handyman in Oregon." Go down the list, type it into my phone like an idiot and call them.

It was all day, every day, 10 hours a day, cold calling till I got 16-18 clients.

## 33 No-Shows in a Row

Right after hip surgery, on painkillers, just sitting here looking at myself in a blank Zoom screen for hours. 33 no-shows in a row.

Thinking: "There's no way. Statistically somebody has to show up."

**What fixed it:** Switched from Facebook lead form ads to a landing page with a book-a-call funnel.

First person that came in: "Yeah, I know what you do. Saw your ads. Love it. Need your service." Easiest close of my life.

Went downstairs, told my mom, "I figured it out."

## The Hockey Stick Growth

**It took me 8 months to get from zero to 4K/month.**

**It took 2 months to get from 4K to 15K.**

That's a huge hockey stick. Understand when you're beating your head into a wall every day - everyone that's ever been successful has done the same thing. You're not doing anything wrong. **That's just what hard feels like.**

## One Channel, One Product, One Avatar

Alex Hormozi: "One channel, one product, one avatar to a million dollars a month."

Everyone was telling me to run ads, that you can't scale a low ticket offer. All those SMMA guys doing 10K/month thinking they're hot shit, telling me to do SMMA - those guys are out of business now, hitting me up asking how to do low ticket.

**At $150K/month, we were still only selling the website, the reviews, the $297 offer.** Only then did we start upselling into ads, AI, other stuff.

## Why Low Ticket Works Better

The type of money you make is very different than how much you make.

**Why would you think you're good enough to ask for $3,000?** I was shitting myself talking to someone for a free trial. I was shaking putting this guy's credit card in for a two-week free trial.

Start small. Scale to 10K/month with low ticket. Get the reps in.

## Making the Math Work

At scale, we just do upsells. Like McDonald's: "Do you want Coke and fries with that?"

"Hey, do you want SEO? Blog posts? Google ads? AI chatbot?"

When somebody already knows, likes, and trusts you, and you have their credit card, it's super simple.

## Customer Success is Everything

At the beginning, I was doing all customer success. Mike was doing all customer success. Our churn was way lower because we were so good at it.

**Key:** Have the CSM educate the prospect all the way through the onboarding process.

"This is why reviews are important."
"When we build your website this way, this is why."
"When we send this invoice, you don't have to remember to request a review because it goes out automatically."

**Customers love to hear how much work you're doing for them.**

## The Commitment

I gave myself one year. I said, "I'm just going to try for one year. If I fail, I'll quit. I won't hold myself accountable. I won't be upset with myself."

That gave me peace and completely removed the fear of not succeeding.

**One year. 12K/month. That's it.**

## The Daily Ritual

I cut off all my friends. Didn't leave the house. Went to bed at 8pm. Woke up at 5am.

I have this little driveway with pebbles. Every morning I would take one pebble and stack it 20 minutes down the road on my morning walk.

Went back there months later - hundreds of pebbles. **Waking up and stacking wins.**

## Choosing a Niche

I just had a friend that worked in his own construction business. That's the only reason I chose contractors.

If my mom was a real estate agent or if I knew someone that was a hairdresser, I would have chosen them.

**Niches are just like video game characters.** They have good stuff and bad stuff. There is no best niche.

## Hitting "Escape Velocity"

At 6-7K/month, you hit escape velocity. You can mess around, spend money on stuff, test things, make bad hires. You have that cushion.

You become dangerous because you can blindly throw $5-6K/month at something and you will find something that works.

## The Turning Point

There's a moment when you can look someone in the eye and say, "Yeah, I have a software company" with utter confidence.

Instead of: "Yeah, I just started this new business. I'm trying to get it to work. I do websites and stuff."

**That's probably the coolest experience I've had in the entire journey - that turning point.**

## Final Advice

If 90% of entrepreneurs had the same mindset of "No matter what happens, I'm just going to try for a year" - the success rate would go up substantially.

Give yourself permission to fail. It's like when you're drunk playing golf - you just don't care, therefore you're better.

**The only thing that made me successful: I just didn't quit.**
