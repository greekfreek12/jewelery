00:00:00
I would cold call and I would get one client [music] a week for $97. Maybe one client every 10 days. All I have to do is do this every day all day for two years and I'll be at 10K a [music] month. One channel, one product, one avatar to a million dollars a week. All right. What's up, guys? My name is Kai. I make 180K a month selling one guy. I love a website. All right. Let me share my screen. Cool. All right. So, let's go here and refresh the stripe real quick just so you guys can see. So, we scaled

00:00:25
from like 30-ishk all the way to 180 in like five or six months or so. So you can see here in March, February, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November. So a little bit over. Um, right now we're at 180K, 597 active subs, and a little bit over uh 1 mil in volume. So yeah, that's me. And uh, yeah, I've been doing this about two years or so. >> Crazy. Crazy. Well, I am stoked to have Kion on. Kai and I talked like almost a year ago when I first started posting

00:00:50
YouTube videos. He just hopped on my calendar and I was like, you know, who is this guy doing the one website template thing? So yeah, that's his claim to fame. Kai, how the hell did you get into this, >> dude? Honestly, so I had I had a friend from college and I I just literally, you know, I was broke and [ __ ] just, yeah, sucked after college. No idea what was going on. So, I called my buddy and I was like, I know you're into something, bro. What are you doing? He's like, dude, I just learned about this

00:01:11
new thing called Go High Level. Instantly, I saw it and I was like, I have no idea how I'm going to make money with this thing, but like this is a [ __ ] amazing tool. So, that was it. Like, I had no idea. And the only reason I chose websites is I just didn't know. I didn't know how to do anything else. And I knew what a website was and I knew that business owners knew what websites were and I was like, "All right, well, I'm just going to do this," you know? >> So, yeah, that's how I got into it.

00:01:31
>> Yeah, >> dude. I love it. I love it. And you uh you say that in your videos. You're like you're like, "I'm pretty much average intelligence and I figured this [ __ ] out, so you can too." So, I like I like I love the transparency there, bro. Like have people on YouTube trying to be like, "Oh, yeah, whatever." Um, but no, I love that. So, you find high level. What's the next couple steps? You're starting to sell websites. How'd you get your first 10 clients? Yeah. So, uh, my

00:01:53
I actually had a business partner originally, Ian. Um, and we're no longer together. Shout out Ian though. Great guy, by the way. Never partner with someone who has the exact same like exact same uh skill set as you. It just doesn't work out. >> Um, but yeah, he flew out here to Hawaii. We boot camp for like 10 days. We just literally just spammed Go High Level, just mess with buttons, press buttons, mess with the website builder, [ __ ] everything up a 100 times. Um, and then we just started cold calling.

00:02:14
Like day three, we just spam cold calls. And uh, yeah, we tried to sell reviews, we tried to sell websites. Neither of us had any idea how to build any of the stuff, >> but we got our first client after like five or six days, I think, of cold calling. We got him on a two-e free trial and then we got him on a $97 a month after that. David, uh, he's a dog groomers. Literally, first client's still with us. So, uh, yeah, dude. Just raw action, man. That's that's the issue is people just don't take action. They

00:02:37
sit on their ass all day and just like, "What if this goes wrong? What if that goes wrong?" >> Bro, shit's going wrong no matter what you do. >> Yeah. No, exactly. Exactly. And I promise you uh you can sit there and watch YouTube videos for four hours or you can make four hours with the colds calls and you will make more money from the cold calls every single time. >> Every single time. Every time. >> So you start cold calling. I'm sure that first uh card on file felt absolutely

00:02:59
euphoric for the dog groomer there. Um but talk us about the skill set. So what were your what's your skill set and uh what was his skill set that y'all had kind of in common? >> Yeah, so he uh Ian my old partner just a sales guy, right? like super super good at talking. Uh loves to talk to the camera, can literally, you know, could talk to a wall. I can do that, too. >> So, it's like we just kind of realized super early on we're like, "Dude, like we need like this is not it, you know? I

00:03:23
love you." And uh that's it. Like we're still friends, but my partner now is like we call him like a little mini Elon Musk. You met him at go high level. He's just like >> this just hyper intelligent backend dude who's just he's a nerd, but he's my nerd. >> Yeah. >> And Yeah. It just works perfectly and jacked. And jacked. >> Yeah. Yeah. So, so if on on the partner thing, I mean, a lot of people ask me like, should I get a partner? I would say 99.9% of the time, no. If it wasn't

00:03:48
for Mike, like he's just a specimen. I just I just would do it yourself, you know? I would find an accountability partner, someone that can kind of work with you and you guys can share ideas, but dude, like, >> yeah, >> I'd do it yourself most of the time. >> For sure. For sure. No, that's what And that's what I see like work way better than the whole like, hey, I'm friends with somebody. we're gonna go into business together and cold call like, "Okay, how about y'all both start your

00:04:07
own business and just be like, you know, buddies there and hold each other accountable." >> That was And that's a super common mistake with beginners. Super common mistake. >> Yeah. But you get that first card on file and you're selling the websites. The first website, I'm guessing y'all did it all yourself. What was delivery like and how is delivery changed from the very first person you onboarded to what does it look like now onboarding 10 people a day? >> Yeah. Yeah. So, first car first car on

00:04:30
file happened in this room actually. My mom was downstairs, me and Ian were up here, and we just started screaming like she thought she thought like we died or something. It was it was like a euphoric experience as you said. It was it was like and it wasn't even wasn't didn't get paid. It was just a trial, you know? >> But when you go from like never selling anything online to like just be like, "Holy [ __ ] in like eight days, we literally just learned a software and sold got somebody to give us their

00:04:49
credit card." It's like a crazy experience, right? So, it was wild. Um, but yeah, first website looked like [ __ ] Like we we really thought it was good. It was like a onepager. Nothing worked. And we just gave this guy like top tier support. like we were just on calls with him all day. Like whatever you need, we got you. Um and the dude was just just the nicest person in the world. Um he's still paying us. But so yeah, the website took us like 20 hours. It looked like [ __ ] Images were all

00:05:11
over the place. Buttons didn't work. Nothing. Like it was just a complete [ __ ] show. Um but like I said, we're on calls with them all day. So he's still paying us. It worked out. Now the delivery is crazy, right? We have a VA. The whole thing's basically built with AI. You we send an onboarding form to the client like I talk about in my YouTube videos. They basically build the website for us with just information. What services you provide, how much do you charge, where you located, business

00:05:32
name, phone. That form basically just goes into chat GBT goes into go high level and boom, the website pops out. We change some images and you get a 25page website for like 50 bucks if you pay a VA and do that correctly. It's crazy. >> Incredible. Yeah. Incredible. So Mike, was Mike the mastermind behind that system or you you are in there as well or >> I I I had a little I had a little little little stuff in there, but it was mostly Mike. But but that being said, like the optimization process, like now if the

00:05:56
optimization process is at a 10 out of 10, like it was still really good at like a four out of 10, five out of 10. >> It was slower, but the quality of the website has been the same for a while. It's just how fast can we get it done, right? Because with with as you scale, you have to get more websites done quick. >> Yeah. >> But for a beginner, and this is another huge mistake, dude, beginners think it has to be perfect and optimized on day one. Bro, we were at 30K a month and our

00:06:17
websites were still a [ __ ] show. Like the websites worked, but like optimization not there. Process took forever. button's broken. Yeah. >> So, beginners, dude, it's just it's just raw action every time. Stop [ __ ] overthinking stuff every time. >> No, 100%. I like to share that story when I'm when I have when I have affiliate come to the community and they're like been on coaching calls for three months and they're still talking about setting their emails up or like

00:06:37
they haven't made their first cold call and I'm like, I made this mistake when I first got started. I spent probably two full weeks building out an onboarding process that was going to automate the most amount amount of stuff possible and I was going to be able to onboard review clients so easily. I had like two clients. I didn't even know how to onboard somebody yet. And I wasted two weeks of growth in in marketing and advertising thinking I was going to build this onboarding process that never

00:07:00
didn't even end up working because I hadn't onboarded enough people. So, it's like you've got to build the plane while you're flying it. You've got to just go out there, mess up, and then you'll learn kind of where to optimize it because people get so bogged down and let me build something cool in and high level. Don't do that. Just go market. Um, one one thing on that, we were at I think I were at 35 or before me and Mike partner, I was at like $34,000 a month. Our email sending domains still didn't

00:07:24
work. We still could not send just just for everyone out there, our emails literally didn't send to clients to at 34K a month. Just to give you like a an idea of like how janky the system is. Like you look at someone at 30K a month and you're like, "Oh, these guys know they're shit." Bro, we're 180k a month now. Like our text messages just got shut down yesterday for a full 24 hours. Like [ __ ] just breaks. >> Yeah. >> So, just to give you guys an idea, you

00:07:44
know? For sure. No, it's all part of it. But um All right. So, somebody's getting started. When you got the guy on the phone and you're selling them, what is your sales pitch? Um I know I know now like I see your ads everywhere. It's like $297. You get a website and all the stuff, but go through your sales pitch. What's kind of your offer? >> I mean, it's $297 a month. We just say, "Hey, this is exactly what we do. Take it or leave it." Like, that's the that's

00:08:06
the messaging because you have to understand like if you're going to build a website and set up these systems, uh you're selling a system, not a lead generation system. Now, leads come as a byproduct of the system you set up. But just because we build someone a 25page website and we get them 50 extra Google reviews, I can't exactly look at that and be like, "Hey, Mr. Contractor, you're going to get this much more business because we did these things for you." I can only tell you that more

00:08:27
Google reviews and a better website, the outcome of that equals more business. >> Yeah. >> So, that's the general messaging and just really being upfront with it. Uh, our biggest issue still is we get the wrong clients who come in expecting a fully generation system and we have to either refund them or there's a horrible client. So again, this only applies at scale. At the beginning, dude, just do whatever you can to get a client through the door and just build a [ __ ] website. Just just just do the thing.

00:08:50
And >> yeah, >> from the beginning, the only advantage I've ever had, the only thing I think I'm actually good at is [snorts] just blindly doing stuff. Like, I'm not techsavvy. Like I said, average intelligence, but dude, I don't I don't give a [ __ ] if I'm embarrassed, if I look dumb. I will just continue to do [ __ ] And that's I think that's the biggest advantage you can have as a beginner by far. >> Yeah. Yeah. No, for sure. No. And that's

00:09:09
huge about setting the expectations of, hey, this is uh we're not running your Facebook ads. We're not running your Google ads. Um I know you might have that as an upsell now, but like we're not generating a whole bunch of leads. We're generating a system in a process that the leads will come as a byproduct. And so um >> like one thing you say in your ads, and I've seen it on your funnel as well, is like, "Oh, we're not another like 15year-old telling you we'll get you 30

00:09:30
booked appointments in the next 10 days." And so your messaging is is very blunt and direct. Did you was that kind of just by nature or did that come from talking to hundreds of contractors and be like this is what they want to hear? >> Both. Both. I mean that was gonna be that was going to be our marketing style regardless. That's why like if I said the same [ __ ] to like med spa owners or dentists, it probably wouldn't work, right? Yeah. >> Just just the the way you resonate is

00:09:51
you have to talk. You have to speak their language. >> Yeah. >> That being said, this is still not stuff that you need to be thinking about day one. Day one, it doesn't matter. Day one, if you lose your client in a month, day one, if you waste all their time and you waste their money, worst case, just refund them, dude. Yeah. Like that's the worst case. pay them their $297. Like, you're not you're not going to break these guys' bank account for $297. Worst case, just refund them. Literally,

00:10:11
nothing bad can happen. You're just going to learn. >> Literally. >> So, I I like I'm fine to talk about this stuff, but like the issue is is beginners hear this stuff and they and they like have all these questions. They're like, "Oh, do I need to do this, this, this, this?" Your first one to 10 clients, it doesn't [ __ ] matter at all. Just get a client and try to onboard them. Like, literally, that's it. It doesn't matter. Like, it's just going to go wrong regardless.

00:10:31
>> Yeah. [laughter] Yeah. >> Yeah. No, for sure. I people say like, "Oh, I've watched your onboarding calls 20 times, Clay." I'm like, "Why don't you go do one?" I >> just do one by one. >> Yeah. 100%. And so, um, what I think what's really unique about you is that as somebody that's doing 180K a month, a lot of times people lose touch of like where you're at at the beginning, right? They lose touch of like what matters then. And you're still, I mean, you've

00:10:53
scaled so quick, so you probably remember it. But, um, after, you know, after you on board the first guy, um, what does one to 100 or one to 10 look like? Are y'all just still cold calling? Um or when did y'all turn on the ads? >> Yeah, like one to I think it's like again me and Mike were separate till I was at 30k a month and he was at like 1520. That's when we partnered. So we had our own separate companies doing the exact same thing. By the way, that's what I mean by find like an

00:11:15
accountability partner. Um but yeah, cold called to like 16 17 clients I think. And then I was around like 3 or 4K a month when I started ads. Again, dude, you start ads, it's going to be a [ __ ] show as well. I wasted like $5,000. I got scammed out of $5,000 from some [ __ ] course. Um, and and yeah, dude, it's just it's a [ __ ] show. But ads ads uh definitely the fastest way to scale. That being said, there's zero reason to spend money on ads if you haven't done a thousand cold calls and figured out your

00:11:39
messaging and how to talk. Otherwise, you're just going to waste money. Your bank account's done and then you're you're back at ground zero. So, you have to get good before you start running ads. >> Yeah. I have actually, you know what, one more thing. This is another mistake with beginners. They look at and they ask me questions now about, hey, what are you doing at 180k a month? So many of the things that apply to me now at 180k a month, you have to just scratch because they don't apply to you from one

00:12:01
to 20 clients. >> Yeah. >> The same way like my investing strategy is is not going to be the same as like Warren Buffett because I have like $100,000 to invest, not 100 billion. Yeah. >> Right. So two different strategies. >> Yeah. No 100%. Um and you you say that about hey you got to make a thousand calls, you got to pop on a thousand sales calls. That is the trench knowledge that someone out there cannot get. You cannot get or steal from somebody from a course or whatever. You

00:12:25
have to go put the reps in because sure you can copy a funnel. We've already talked about this before. You can copy a funnel word from word, but you know, copy expires. Eventually, that's not going to resonate anymore and you won't know why it worked in the first place. And so, you won't be able to just kind of replicate and continue to get results um when things change. So, that's that's gold there. What we talked about, you started with cold calling, now you do ads. Ads are really a quick way to

00:12:48
scale. Cold calling is important. Walk us through how you cold called, where you got the list, what was your process, and walk us through that. Yeah. So, I I love what you said. Winning in the weeds is super important. So, when you win in the weeds, you have more context than literally everyone else. Like, I've done I don't even know how many thousands of cold calls. I've done four or 5,000 just or four or 5,000 calls just on Zoom with contractors, close or not close. So, when you have that much experience,

00:13:10
right, like other stuff is just going to come easier and come more naturally. Uh so, yeah, cold called uh have no idea how long. Um, but yeah, after the cold calling, started ads like 3 or 4K, pumped as much money into ads as we could, and then just found a winning ad, winning a couple winning ads, and duplicated those ads and just kept running around those messaging. Um, sorry, dude, what was the original question? >> Yeah. When you were calling, what were you saying? And where were you kind?

00:13:32
>> How do we find the list? Right. So, this is this is unbelievable. So, people, again, this goes back to beginners. You think you need some crazy system to like, you know, have a dialer and have all the leads set up and everything. I would literally take my iPhone, I would go on Google Maps and type in roofer in Las Vegas. And then the next day I would type in handyman in Oregon and literally just go down the list, look at the look at the thing on Google Maps, type it into my phone like a [ __ ] idiot and

00:13:54
call them. Like that's how bad it was. Now, now I would definitely use a dialer. Like I would use Kixie or something like that. But use some kind of a dialer that you can just connect because it's all about how many how many people can you talk to in an hour and then also it builds thick skin. You get good at talking and then you understand like what your market is looking for. That's it. And you just spam that. You just you just spam that. It was all day, every day, 10 hours a day, cold calling

00:14:16
till I got 16 to 18 clients. >> Yeah. Yeah. No, I love it. And and you you mentioned I I heard in one of your videos, you mentioned a point where you were on like the 30th no-show in the row in a row or something and you were like, "Bro, I'm gonna quit this." What Wait, what is that story like? And how did you fix uh 30 no shows in a row? >> Yeah. So, yeah. So, 33 no-shows in a row, dude. And it was right after I had hip surgery as well. So, I was all I was on painkillers and [ __ ] And I was just

00:14:42
sitting here just I know you know the feeling, but just looking at yourself in a blank Zoom screen for hours and just 33 no-shows in a row and you're just sitting there just you looking at the camera and you're just thinking there's no way there's no way this I was just thinking there's no way I can be on 30 and just like statistically somebody has to show up. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Um so yeah, 33 no-shows. Um I tweaked the ads a little bit and actually switched to like just running them to

00:15:03
like an actual instead of a Facebook lead form ad. >> Facebook lead form ads are shitty as hell. They're actually a lot better now, but at the time they did not work well at all because you couldn't disqualify. So anyway, we switched to like a landing page. We set up a basic book a call funnel. And the first person that came in the door was like, "Yeah, I know what you do. Saw your ads. Love it. Need your service." The easiest clothes of my life. And I I literally went downstairs.

00:15:22
I was like, "Mom, I figured it out. Figure it out." And then from there, uh, two months later, back to like 15 16k a month. >> Yeah. >> Um, also one more thing for beginners because I know a lot of these guys are going to have less than 20 30 clients. You have to understand that what how long it takes you get to get from like one to 30 clients is going to be significantly longer than 30 to 100 clients. It's not even the same time horizon. Just to give you an idea, it took me eight months to get from zero to

00:15:48
like 4K a month. It took two months to get from 4K to like 15K. So just think about how big of a that's a huge hockey stick. >> Yeah. >> So understand when you're beating your [ __ ] head into a wall every single day on no-shows. I did the same [ __ ] Clay did the same [ __ ] Everyone that's ever been successful with a business has done the same [ __ ] You're not doing anything wrong. That's just what hard feels like. Literally. >> Yeah. No, 100%. It is. It is. For me, I

00:16:10
would I would go on either a walk or I would like lay on the ground and be like, "What the [ __ ] am I doing?" [laughter] I'm like in my room like on the rug. I'm like laying there like what am I doing my life? It's the weirdest feeling. But um yeah, like you said, like I we've been averaging about 30 to 50 new customers onboarded a month. It took me like seven months to get to 50 clients. like it took me forever and we're just doing reviews. And so that kind of segus

00:16:34
in the second part about you sell a system, right? You're not selling like lead generation, Facebook ads, whatever. You sell a system that these contractors need. And um obviously we have AI messaging and stuff here and there. But um it's so tempting to be like, "Oh, I'm going to go jump to a new offer and we're going to do AI receptionist as the front, you know, front end or we're going to do some AI stuff." But you've kept your messaging and offer very consistent. What's the reasoning behind

00:16:58
that? you are y'all trying to add on AI stuff? I like I've just done reviews. I've been so like out of the AI stuff. So, I want to hear kind of where you're at on on that. >> Just Alex or Mosi. So, it just it just repeated in my head. Uh what is it? One channel, one product, one avatar to a million dollars a month. Like literally, that's it. And uh when I started with the 297 and the websites, I was, you know, we were in different communities. Everyone was telling me to run ads.

00:17:20
Everyone was telling me you can't scale a low ticket offer. >> All these SMA guys doing like, you know, 10K a month thinking they're hot [ __ ] They're like, "Yeah, you should do SMMA." All those guys, by the way, are out of business now, transitioning, hitting me up, asking me how to do low ticket. Um, so yeah, it's it's just that if you can just remember that, dude. Everything works. If there's somebody out there doing it, it works. One avatar, one channel, one product to a

00:17:40
million dollars a year, literally. And then at a million dollars a year, then you can switch it up. >> Um, only now, and this is another thing, >> 150k a month hits. At 150k a month, we were still only selling like the the website, the reviews, the 297 offer, that's it. only at $150,000 a month over like 400 and something clients. Only then do we start upselling into ads, AI, other stuff. And we're all we're working on that stuff now. But understand how far we got with a basic $297 offer. Look

00:18:08
how far you got with just selling reviews. >> Pick one thing. Pick one avatar. Sell the [ __ ] out of it. Get really good at selling it because then you become a master with that one thing. And you can a million dollars a million dollars a year, dude. That's it. >> And then figure it out from there. It's not rocket science. >> For sure. >> Actually, actually, it's pretty hard. I won't lie. It's pretty hard. [laughter] >> Well, it's it's simple. It's simple, not

00:18:28
easy, right? It's simple, not easy, right? It's uh it's it's easy to explain, really hard to do. Um but people can still do it. And that's like to touch on the SMA stuff, people out of business. The SMA and you'll I think you'll be a great you a testament to this SMA I think got so popular and there are so many people doing it because literally the hardest thing that you and I do in our businesses when we're selling to small business owners is to get a card on file is to get them

00:18:52
to trust you to hand you money. That is the hardest thing you do. And so that's why when you're doing higher ticket, you it's easier to get to 10K a month because you only need five or six people to say yes to you, right? And and this is something Matt Denno says and it's been affirmed to me. It's like getting a business owner to give you $100 and getting them to give you $1,000 is not 10 times harder, right? It's not 10 times harder. It's like maybe two times harder, right? It's a little bit harder

00:19:15
to get them to give you a thousand, but just the card in general and giving you that cash is is is very challenging. And so the SMA thing, you can get to 10K, 20K a month pretty quickly. I got to 20K per month or 18K per month. Um, like six or seven months in SMA. But the type of business that I had at 17K per month for SMA is all day delivery, clients churning, constant hamster wheel, the type of business I had when I was doing 17K a month with Review Harvest was just like this, just steady up to the right,

00:19:43
you know, and like not nearly as much as y'alls. Y'all is like, you know, taking off. But yeah, what's the difference? explain to the audience what's the difference in the low ticket stuff. >> It's a beautiful thing. That's that's a that's a amazing point and I think this is one thing maybe my only other advantage early on was I just I for some reason I knew this what you just said. So the kind of money you make that it's the kind of money you make is very

00:20:04
different than like how much you make, right? So like you just said the type of money you make with a low ticket program going like this as opposed to this is significantly better for your mental just everything. Also this is huge as a beginner. Why do you think you're Why do you think you're good enough to get on and ask for $3,000 and you can actually provide a $3,000 service? Bro, I would I was [ __ ] myself talking to someone for a free trial. I was shaking putting this guy's credit card in for a twoe

00:20:28
free trial. And I'm a pretty confident dude. Imagine some nerd who's 18 years old trying to sell someone on a $3,000 program. Bro, are you going to [ __ ] your pants? >> Yeah. >> Like you you you have to start small. And dude, scale to 10K a month with low ticket. If you want to go do SMA, then go do SMA. But if you're a beginner, going through the process and getting the reps of getting someone's credit card, fulfilling a service, doing client delivery, hiring a VA, uh building out

00:20:50
the systems, uh client retention, check-in calls, um just building building a salesunnel, running ads, those skills will stack so high that by the time you actually have any kind of a decent business, like you you can go do other things, but get the reps in on like dude, that's why we started with free trials. We just wanted to get the reps in. Get the reps in and then you can do other [ __ ] later. But yeah, so many kids start and they're like, "Oh, I can't sell a $3,000 piff. Like, I'm

00:21:12
gonna quit." Bro, go sell something for a free trial or 97 bucks. Do that 10 times. Go through that. Like, then when you sell that $3,000 piff, you'll actually be able to sell it because you're confident, right? It's just reps. It's just reps. >> 100%. I think I think too a lot of people's hesitation with the low ticket stuff is that in the beginning it feels like a whole bunch of work for a very low very small amount of money. Like I I remember like when I first started

00:21:38
making some of the affiliate money and I was like I was having people like check out on school or Stripe or whatever and like just pay for my stuff in full and I was like this person just gave me like $800 and I also sat on a call today for an hour and 45 minutes arguing with somebody over a free trial for reviews. Like this is like totally different and so it can be discouraging but it stacks way differently. So how do you how do you make the math make sense now that you all have scaled run ads have a sales

00:22:03
team? How do you all make the math make sense on the low ticket stuff? >> Yeah. So again, what I'm going to say, this is more advanced. We only implemented this past maybe 100 200k, 100 120k a monthish, but we just do upsells now. So if you ever gone to McDonald's, right, and they, you know, they offer you a burger. They say, "Hey, do you want Coke and fries with that?" So we just apply the same logic to the business. Hey, so we have the website here. Do you want SEO? Do you want blog

00:22:26
posts? Do you want um you want Google ads? Uh do you want a calendar booking? Do you want an AI chatbot? Whatever whatever else, right? So, it's like when somebody already knows, likes, and trusts, you have their credit card. It's super simple. Hey, do you want this? You already have this. >> So, that's how we that's how we make the math work more at scale. Yeah. >> Um, at the beginning, we still we're just fighting for one to one on the front end trying to $300 to acquire,

00:22:45
$300 upfront cash. >> Obviously, with sales people and stuff, that math changes, >> but uh in my head, dude, I just I just saw $300 and I was just >> It didn't really make sense. Like, now looking back, I was like, "Nobody's ever going to turn me, right?" That was just my dumbass mindset. I was just like, "Yo, this is $300. I'm gonna get forever, right? And that was just like the the [ __ ] mindset I had forever, right? [laughter] >> Um, just to give you an idea of how

00:23:10
locked in I was and how locked in if you're a beginner you should be. I would cold call and I would get one client a week for $97, maybe one client every 10 days. And I literally was telling my friend, I was like, "Dude, all I have to do is do this every day all day for two years and I'll be at 10K a month." Like, and like saying that now sounds so stupid, but that is how committed I was to doing that. I was like, I'm just going to do this. I found a channel that worked. >> I'm just going to do this. Yep.

00:23:35
>> Right. So, just to give you an idea of like that like almost autistic mindset, but that's what you have to have at the beginning to win, literally. >> No, 100%. And I think what people get lost and they quit and stuff because they do this thing of constant new, right? They're constant new and they're constantly, you know, performing below where they could be performing with the stuff that actually worked. That was the same exact way. I was like, "Hey, if I get like when I was doing the review

00:23:56
stuff and I kind of gotten steady in it, I was like, if I get two clients a week, I'll be at like 20K a month by the end of next year or whatever." And literally, it would be like Wednesday or Thursday and I'm like, I'm going to do whatever I can to get two clients a week. I'm not worried about scale. I'm just worried about getting in front of the most amount of people possible. So, it's pulling out my phone, texting my contacts, texting my current customers for referrals, doing whatever is

00:24:16
possible to actually get those customers. Um, and then what happens is is like once you get that base, then yes, you do start to figure out you have other options of ads and other ways to scale. But it is like it takes that like, hey, I know I can get two clients a week if I do this and I'm just going to do that and I'm not going to look at anything new. I'm not going to worry about the AI cold callers. I'm not going to worry about the, you know, AI this, AI that, whatever. And I'm just going to

00:24:38
put my head down and grind. Um, so no, that's that's absolutely fire. Um, one thing I want to talk to you about with um, the actual fulfillment is because I know, like I said, we're talking a lot about beginners getting started. Once again, you're not you don't want to worry that about this stuff, but you are going to have questions about how it works. And so, when you're getting them the leads, are you getting how many of your customers use the lead connector app? How many of them log into the

00:25:03
software? Are y'all just delivering the leads and saying, "Hey, go follow up with them or what are y'all doing from that perspective with y'all's?" >> Yes, you're Yeah, 100%. So you're delivering and you're selling a system, not a service, right? So we want them using these systems. So that means if we can get them on calendar, in a perfect world, you'd have a contractor come in, give them a website, give them an invoice system, give them a calendar

00:25:20
booking system, and have them using the app all day long to respond to the leads. That is a top tier. That is best case scenario because you're being sticky. And just to go back to what you said about beginners, you don't have to worry about this stuff at the start, but this vision is what made me scale. understanding if I could be sticky and get them to use the app all day long and actually use the software, they would stick forever and ever and ever and ever. So yes, beginners, you don't have

00:25:42
to worry about this, but if you lock this vision in and understand how sticky this [ __ ] really is. When you get a $300 a month client, you're going to understand how they're just going to stick forever. Hypothetically, right? Obviously, at scale, [ __ ] breaks. But at the beginning, like it doesn't. Your clients, if you give them a good customer experience service, we'll stick with you, especially at the beginning. Only at scale does [ __ ] break. Um but [clears throat] yeah, so we just try to

00:26:03
get them using the app as much as humanly possible, respond to their leads inside the app, respond to reviews inside the app. Um only now we're trying to get people on invoicing and calendar systems because if they can if they use that mobile app to operate their business, dude, they will never leave because they're using your your software as the core foundation that their business runs on. So you have to have that mindset and that vision when you're building a system. You're selling a

00:26:25
system, not a service. You have to remember that >> 100%. And high level has done a whole bunch of research on this and lead connector is the number one thing that keeps people around. It's like it is the buzzing pocket effect as they call it. It is getting notifications from lead connector all day. New review, new lead, respond to lead, messaging people through here. Um if they are on the lead connector app, they are going to stick and um one the the the other side of the coin there is now you are so involved in

00:26:50
their business and and now you are kind of opening yourself up to more support, more questions. Hey, this isn't working. Hey, the invoice didn't go through or whatever. How are y'all dealing with that at y'all's scale? Is it just building out a support team or is it training them on the onboarding call? What do y'all do there? >> Yeah, a bunch. I mean, tequila really helps. Whiskey really helps. Like, you know, [laughter] it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] show, dude. I won't lie. Like, you have

00:27:11
to understand this is a [ __ ] show. Our business is a [ __ ] show, right? It is. And like anyone who says otherwise is just completely [ __ ] lying. >> Y >> um so yeah, that's a problem. Like we get we get some customers that are just such nightmares and they have all these questions. Um, Michael, my partner, is really good at building a customer success team. So, we have like six customer success managers. Honestly, we probably should have 10. >> Um, but yeah, you just have to train

00:27:33
them well and understand like at the beginning, I was doing all the customer success. Mike was doing all the customer success. >> The customer success at scale is the key to actually having low churn in a really scalable company. Because I can tell you right now, when I was my own customer success manager and Mike was his own customer success manager, our churn was way lower because we were so good at it, right? So also with customer success, a key and golden nugget with this with CSM stuff is having the CSM customer success

00:27:59
manager educate the prospect the whole way through the onboarding process. Hey, this is why reviews are important. Hey, when we build your website this way, this is why it's important. Hey, when we have a web web chat down here, lots of people don't like to call. It's 2025. People are socially awkward. That's why we put the web chat here so they can text if they're [ __ ] weird, >> right? So we have the CSM educate the prospect all the way through. Hey, this is why this way of sending an invoice is

00:28:21
better. Hey, when we send this invoice, guess what? You don't have to remember to actually request a review because a review request goes out automatically. So, the whole way educating the customer on why what you're doing is valuable and then also telling them all the stuff you're doing. Like like customers love to hear how much work you're doing for them. >> So, it's it's just customer support. And dude, it's a [ __ ] nightmare. Like, it's it is a night like it just sucks.

00:28:42
and and you you get better at scale. But it just that's the thing with beginners is they think shit's going wrong and they're they think they're doing something wrong. I'm telling you right now, we have 600 clients. [ __ ] goes wrong every day. Like every >> day, >> it never stops. So just get used to it, honestly. >> Yeah. No, for sure. No, it's it's such a realistic point of view of business because like a lot of people that make YouTube videos are selling the dream,

00:29:04
right? Selling the dream. Selling the dream. Selling the dream. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. But ultimately like the number one comment I get on my videos is like thanks to your transparency. like thanks for your transparency because that's what people are like craving nowadays and yeah you're so transparent in your videos you're like you know talking about all the downsides of it as well and so um no that's really good I think something like somebody's listening to this and

00:29:23
doing reviews one thing that we found as well when I get off the onboarding calls as the founder I know like we've got to get a CSV file uploaded like now like it's not a hey let me go look at it later hey let me send this off to my train let's send this off to my VA to like go through it it's like hey we need a you know Google business profile connected and we need a CSV file because those are the two biggest things on the onboarding call and like they'll tell you all these little things, but you

00:29:46
kind of have to have those subtle nudges of educating them of like why why we needed to do this because once you get profile connected and you get the CSV file, you can start doing the reactivation, you can start getting them reviews. Then when you pick up the phone after you've gotten them 20 reviews, they normally answer and they'll give you another call if you got to go down the onboarding funnel and stuff like that and do more stuff. You're cold calling all day long. You know, obviously cold calling is not fun. What

00:30:07
is like the why behind what is your kind of the the fuel in the tank that gets that got you to keep going um when you wanted to not keep going? >> Yeah. I I don't know he says this but like what do you have to lose? Like if if you know I'm I'm freaking a bunch of shoulder issues, back issues. I'm taking painkillers all day long. I'm living with my mom. I'm 25 years old. I'm broke. Like you know my mom's like [ __ ] helped me pay for groceries and [ __ ] It's like what do I have to lose?

00:30:33
Am I going to sit in my mom's house all day and jerk off and play video games like I was before? It's like there's there's literally nothing to lose. So to me, there was just no other option, >> right? It's like imagine going on Hinge and going on a Tinder day and being like, yeah, I live with my mom and I play video games all day. Like, dude, you're a [ __ ] loser. You're not going to have a good life. >> Yeah. >> So that that is kind of like the northstar of like, dude, I have no other

00:30:52
option. Like something has to change because like it can't get worse, literally. Right. Which is sad, but it's just it's hilarious because it was just so true. >> Yeah. um that and then I think just like watching podcasts from Hermosi, Chris Chris Williamson, >> um Jay Waller, all these guys that you look up to and you're like, "Hey, I want to be like that." I think listening to advice from anyone anyone's life that you don't want the life that they have is stupid,

00:31:16
>> right? So, if you're if you're watching a podcast and you're taking advice from someone who doesn't have the life that you are looking to build, there's no reason to follow their advice. So, I would watch these podcasts. I would go like, "Dude, I love that these guys have this platform and they're sharing all this inspirational stuff about uh how they built their business and how to make money and and they came from the bottom and all this stuff and they're

00:31:34
able to influence people like we are now on this podcast. Like this is so cool to me, >> right? That that I can be a success story and inspiration for other people is super cool." So, I would watch those podcasts all day. I still did the same thing like every other beginner. Mentally masturbated for three months, you know, figured out what business model to start. uh you know, made a billion excuses like as to why it wouldn't work. And then one day you just wake up and you're just like, dude, like

00:31:56
>> I have no other option. I have to make something work. >> Um otherwise, like dude, you're just going to end up with a sad sad [snorts] life and you only got one, you know? >> Yeah, dude. 100%. No, I think that we all know the quote like you turn up you turn out to be the five people you spend the most time with. But I think like where this hasn't gotten caught up is that nowadays we I can spend more time with Alex Rosie than anybody else in my life. Alex Rosie puts out hours of

00:32:20
content every single day. Alex Mosie can be my mentor. It might lack some context. That's why I paid 6K for his little AI thing so he can have a little more context on me. But um but yeah, no, we can surround ourselves with the absolute That's the amazing thing about the internet, with the absolute best entrepreneurs in the world and we can, you know, that'll rub off on us for sure. Um and this is probably something you get all the time in your comments. Um beginners listening to this would be

00:32:46
like, "Okay, well who do I call? Do I niche down? who do I niche down to? Walk us through your decision to go with contractors um and what you would recommend to a beginner about the whole niching down thing. >> 100%. And and last point on what you just said, uh I cut off all my I didn't leave the house. I cut off all my friends. I literally went to bed at 8:00 p.m. Woke up at 5:00 a.m. And and one last thing, like I have this little like this little driveway on my on my road out there and like there's all these

00:33:10
little pebbles and every single morning I would just take one pebble and I would just stack it like 20 minutes down the road on my morning walk. And it's really cool, dude, because like I I went back there a couple months ago. I'm like, oh my god, there's like hundreds of pebbles here, >> right? So, just one one small cool story. I just was looking at the other day and I'm like, this is sick. So, yeah, it's just waking up and stacking stacking wins, >> right? >> That is so I love that because I used to

00:33:32
like think of I used to envision it of like, hey, I'm walking up to this massive boulder. I've got a chisel and a hammer and I'm just going to chip on it today. That's it. And over time, you create something. But what a great visual. Like somebody need like maybe like get a some everybody listening get a mason jar if you're in the if you're in the pain cave right now. Get a mason jar and go grab a pebble or a rock every single day and leave that mason mason jar in your in your desk and don't make

00:33:54
a singleing excuse or skip the business model or you know go to the next thing or try the new AI caller until that mason jar is full as hell and you got you know got a gallon size big. Um so yeah one last sorry one last thing on that point and this was this was probably the key this was the nugget. I think this was why this is why I succeeded. If I had to pick one thing, I just remember waking up and and looking at like, you know, some dumbass Tik Tok about what would happen if you really tried for one year at something. I was

00:34:18
like, "Okay, let me try." I literally gave myself one year. I was just like, "I'm just going to try for one year. If I fail, I'll quit. Whatever. I'm just going to try every single day for one year, and if I don't make it, I will give my myself permission to stop and to quit. And I will not hold myself accountable. I won't be upset with myself. Um, I won't be depressed. I'm going to try for one year and one year only. And if at the end of it I don't

00:34:39
make it, I don't make it and that's fine. And I just set that boom, one year, 12K a month. >> That's it. Yeah. >> Right. And I really believe that. And that gave me almost like peace and like completely removed the the need to succeed and this like fear of not succeeding because I was like, "Okay, whatever. I'm just going to try for a year. It doesn't matter. I'm just going to show up for one year and if I don't make it, I'll go back to jerking off and

00:34:59
playing video games all day." Is what it is. You know, >> that No, that's so valuable. I think what you had right was the expectation piece. you said, "Hey, I just have to I just have to keep doing the cold calls all day and get one client every 10 days and in two years I'll be at 10K a month." You had the expectation piece, right? But a lot of people will think, "Oh, I'm going to make 20K a month the sec on the second month or the third month or whatever." And they get to the

00:35:21
third month and they're at 2K or 3K >> or they don't even have a client or they don't even have a client. >> Yeah. [laughter] But they just they they they don't have a realistic expectation of how long things are supposed to take. And so they quit even though they might be like making progress, they quit because they expected their expectations were crazy. Um, and so keeping those realistic expectations of, hey, like you said, your first 0 to 30 clients are going to take 10 times as long as your

00:35:44
30 to 60. Um, and so just keeping the expectations there is so valuable and that you had that kind of in check. >> Thousand%. And to answer your question about niching and because that was your original question is like, you know, how do you choose a niche? How do you choose one product, one avatar, whatever. Dude, I just had a friend that worked in his own construction business. Like, that is the only reason I chose contractors is because I had some kind of a a semblance of a connection to somebody that ran

00:36:07
that type of business. If my mom was a real estate agent or if I knew someone that was a hairdresser, I would have chosen them. >> Literally, that's it. Because they all work. And if anyone's ever played video games out there, niches are just like video game characters. They have really good stuff about them and really bad stuff about them. Yeah. >> Right. Contractors, like I can talk to them well because I am the way I am. um hairdressers pro like every single niche has different things that are good and

00:36:28
bad. There is no best niche just like there's no one best character. Otherwise, everyone would just choose that niche and there'd be no businesses besides that niche. That's why there's multi-billion dollar corporations working with every single niche because every niche works, right? So, super important to understand and to not overthink that. Super important. >> Yeah. Well, and that's shortcutting the thousand cold calls. If your dad's a plumber and your friend's a plumber and

00:36:49
you've been around plumbing your whole life, um, if you go start working with plumbers, you still need should do a thousand cold calls 100%. But you on their first cold call, you will know so much more about how they speak, what their life's like, what their pain points are just because you've been around it. Um, and so that's a fire point there. And then back to the niche thing. Yeah, there's no great niche. And then in every single niche, you have shitty and you have good, right? Like

00:37:12
the bottom 50% of every single niche suck. like they they they don't have CRM, they don't, you know, they don't use any tech, you know, they do everything on pen and paper, they don't collect money, they all cash, they don't keep their contact information, like they don't do anything, you know, and they suck. But the top 50% of every niche is where you start to be like, "Okay, we can work with these people. We can help these people." Um, and so just something to think about. If you reach

00:37:34
out to a thousand plumbers and they all suck, you might be reaching out to the bottom 20% or bottom 30% of that industry. And so just keep that in mind there for >> it doesn't matter. You still got to do the reachouts. Doesn't it doesn't matter if you get a thousand injections in a row, man, because on like you will get one and you're like, "Holy [ __ ] this is this works." >> Like literally. >> Yeah. >> Yeah, dude. And it just that's why I like spending so much time on the

00:37:54
mindset and stuff as a beginner because I just remember that so vividly. And I think I mean, dude, the tech stuff comes, like learning the stuff comes, whatever, but it's like just not quitting. And everyone says that, but it's like, dude, that's just the only thing I had that I think made me successful is like, dude, you just you have to have that dog on you. Like there's nothing that could have stopped me from quitting before a year. Like that was it. And like dude, I swear to

00:38:15
God, if 90% of people I'm I'm sorry, if entrepreneurs had that same mindset and they were like, "Yo, no matter what happens, I'm just going to try for a year." I think the success rate for how many people actually built good businesses would go up like substantially. But I think people, like you said, have the wrong expectations and they quit and then they're depressed and it just they just spiral. But if you give yourself a year and you're like, I don't give a [ __ ] if I make it or fail,

00:38:36
dude. It's it's like when you're drunk playing golf. It's like you just don't care, therefore you're just better. Like you get better at certain things when you're drunk, like golf. That's why you're not allowed to drink in [ __ ] professional golf tournaments, right? Literally, it's like a performance performance enhancement drug. So, um that's the same mindset I used and I applied to business, bro. I was just like, "Fuck it. If I fail, I fail. But

00:38:55
regardless, it's going to be a year. No matter what, nobody's going to stop me." >> Yeah. No, that's so good. And I think like you said about people let the tech stuff, they let all the things they don't know stop them. But if you get if you do the marketing side, if you do the marketing side, you get cash collected and you get money, you will figure out the rest. You will figure out the tech stuff. I had somebody on the podcast last week that hasn't come out yet, but

00:39:17
I specifically remember when they joined the community and they were asking all these tech questions and I was like, "Yo, like do some cold calls. Yo, reach out to some people, do some cold email, whatever you got to do." And asking all these tech questions and now they've been in it for like seven or eight months. They're like around 4K a month, I think. And um and I asked them on the podcast specifically. I was like, "So, is the tech piece like overwhelming to me?" And she like barely even remember

00:39:40
the fact that she didn't know how the tech stuff worked. She's like, "Oh yeah, it's like second nature now." It's like I click here, you click there. It's like you will learn high level. I swear it looks, you know, it might look a little bit overwhelming, but you'll know like the back of your hand as long as you don't quit and just keep showing up >> a thousand and and dude, the tech stuff is so daunting. I have three broken keyboards from like my first month of

00:39:58
trying to learn go high level. I'm not even kidding. Like I am not good with technology, dude. I This is my You can't see it, but this is my third Logitech G43 keyboard because I just I literally just sit here and just like be like, "All right, I'm over it." Boom. Chuck it against the wall. I'm [ __ ] going outside. I got to I got to cool off and I had to order another one from Amazon. But the tech stuff is so daunting and hard, dude. And I promise you now, dude, I could do go high level blindfolded.

00:40:19
And I'm not a tech guy. So do not worry about the tech. Sales and marketing and being the engine of your business early on is the most important thing by far. being the engine that gets the train moving out of the station and actually getting clients and doing sales and marketing and letting people know about your stuff. The only thing that matters from the first until honestly 10 20k a month and then you can start getting the tech stuff, optimizing your systems, uh doing all the nerd [ __ ] that you know

00:40:41
Mike does now, thank God. But but literally, dude, 20k a month just take action and do sales and marketing. That's it. >> Yeah, for sure. Well, no, I think that's absolutely fire. Like we saw on your screenshot earlier though, we had a very sharp curve up straight. So, if we get a little bit more advanced here for a second, uh, for the people that might already be seeing some success, they want something a little bit deeper. What was the one thing or what was one of the biggest things? Obviously, it's probably

00:41:06
100 small things, but what was one of the biggest things that took y'all you from growing like this to like and getting 180K a month right now? >> Yeah. I mean, number one, it was partnering with Mike. So, like right there is when I partnered with Mike and that and that is when we were just able to go crazy. That being said, even before that, it was kind of hockey sticking and that was just literally double down on on stuff that worked. So, finding ads that worked and then copying the messaging and just having big balls

00:41:28
and just spending a bunch of money on ads and [ __ ] hoping you see a return on investment, dude. Literally, like literally like like it is a scary thing to see ad accounts at $200, $300 a day. Now, obviously, we're we're way more than that, but you just have to have balls and look at it almost like a video game. Like, you have to look at your ad account like a video game. Cool, I spent 500 bucks, I got $400 back. I know that $400 is going to be recurring. So, ne next month it'll be 800 and at least I

00:41:52
broke even if not a little bit more. Understand when you're when you're doing this model that me and Clay are talking about, you are building a recurring revenue uh business model, >> right? So, that means when you let's say you spend $300 and you acquire $150 a month customer, the next month you're going to break even. Almost every customer as long as you give decent customer service is going to stay two two months. So, whatever your cost is on the front end, you can literally double

00:42:14
it on profit on the back end. And you have to think like that, right? So you can't stress and understand that revenue, recurring revenue. >> H It's a beautiful model. It just keeps stacking, stacking, stacking, stacking. It's [ __ ] amazing, dude. >> Yeah. >> Like it's just a beautiful thing, right? Show. It's beautiful. >> Yeah. Yeah. No, you said it's so worth it. We We talk all the [ __ ] about about how it sucks and all stuff, but it is at the end of the day, it is so worth it.

00:42:36
I've said it a million times, but when you get the Stripe notification for 200 bucks or 300 bucks from someone you haven't talked to in a year, like that is the best feeling. I swear. And once you have 510k a month in recurring revenue, whatever it is, um, you also have a cushion there, right? You you you know, you're one-on-one on the front end or maybe you're paying 800 bucks for $400 in recurring revenue, but hopefully you should have 5, 10, eventually 30, 40, 50k, that's going to help you

00:43:00
cushion that um, and keep spending ad on on ads aggressively. >> When you hit 10K a month, I would say I would say 10K is even even six or 7K. I call it like escape velocity. like you've hit you've hit escape velocity where it's like okay you can kind of like mess around and [ __ ] up and spend a bunch of money on stuff that you probably shouldn't like ads or testing new things or bad hires or uh you know bad bad website designers whatever and you have that cushion in your mind of

00:43:24
like okay I know at at the bare minimum I'm still getting six or $8,000 next month let's say you're at 10k a month you know worst case scenario you're still getting 8k all your clients are not cancelling in one month and when you have that cushion and you have like you become dangerous you become really dangerous because you know you're having you have eight or 10k and when you can blindly throw five $6,000 a month at something, you will find something that works. Like the amount of times I just

00:43:46
blindly threw money at ads that I just thought would work because I knew I had five or six $8,000 coming the next month. Ridiculous. And what happened? I eventually found ads that worked and one or two really good ads took me to 15 20k a month. But I just kept testing [ __ ] I kept saying dumb [ __ ] I kept getting on the camera. I kept posting the ad. Even even here because I live in Hawaii, people like people I don't know. I know they're making fun of me because they see my ads all over the internet, right?

00:44:09
And you a lot of people are so uncomfortable to even get on camera. Who gives a [ __ ] dude? I'm making 180K a month. Like they're gonna all like they might laugh at you at the beginning. >> Like now it's like it is what it is, dude. I'm [ __ ] crushing it. And it was embarrassing at the start. I really wanted to take my ads down at the start actually because I just heard all that [ __ ] and people were, you know, making fun of me and stuff behind my back. And now I'm just like, well, these ads are

00:44:30
blasting, bro. $2,000 a day, it's game over, baby. >> [laughter] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Um, yeah. Know it's funny how like I was the same way like I was getting started when I started posting videos about you about high level. I was like should I do like not my last name. Should I have like a different name there so like you know people don't find if they search it up or whatever. But it's like dude at the end of the day it's never it's none of it matters anyways. But uh

00:44:52
>> it's scary at the start though man. You're very I was very scared about what people would think and people are going to see my my you my company and be like oh this guy's not going to make it. Oh he looks so dumb on camera. like, you know, oh, he's trying to start some dumb [ __ ] web design company. Like, dude, you care at the beginning. >> Yeah. >> You care for I cared till I was at like probably 15, 10, 15K. And then I was just like, oh, like this is real now.

00:45:12
Because it doesn't feel real. Like, let's say you're a beginner and you start making a little bit of money and somebody asks you what you do. Your first thought is not, oh, I run a software company. You're just like, oh, I, you know, I'm trying to make this business work. I don't really know what I'm doing. when you hit like six or you start to make more money than most people make at working a normal job, something changes and you're like, "Holy [ __ ] like I actually do this now."

00:45:33
Right? It's a whole different thing to be able to look someone in the eye and be like, "Yeah, I have a software company." And you say it with utter confidence as opposed to like saying, "Yeah, I just started this new business. I'm trying to get it to work. Um, but yeah, I like do websites and stuff." >> Not confident, right? So there there's a turning point in there. And you guys, that is the most beautiful [ __ ] thing. And I don't remember when that happened. I think it was at 10K a month,

00:45:53
but I was like, "Oh shit." like this is my job. Like this is what I do. Like I'm a I'm a I'm a software guy. >> Yeah. >> So, uh so yeah, that's probably the coolest experience that I've had in the entire journey is that that turning point. >> Yeah, it was I honestly I think I hit like 23 or 24K a month before I stopped telling people, oh, I'm in marketing. People ask, "Oh, what do you do?" I'm like, "I'm in marketing. I'm in

00:46:14
marketing." You know, just because I I you know, you know, I was like, "You're using high level." And you're like, "Guys, what what's real? What's not?" But then like, "Yeah, [ __ ] a software company." You know, we're good. >> Um >> dude, I love it. This was amazing. Uh, where can people find you? We'll obviously put links in the description and stuff, but where should they find you? >> Yeah, man. Just uh Kyone YouTube 808 uh
